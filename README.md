# AREP
In this folder you will find two python routines that contain:

  - "VDI_PET_corrected.py" the corrected version of the PET thermal comfort index after the VDI norm (based on Djordje Spasic's python translation of the fortran code https://github.com/stgeorges)
  - "PET_fsolve_code.py" a more compact and efficient version of the PET comfort index

You are free to use them on the condition to cite the authors
   "E. Walther (AREP) and Q. Goestchel (ENS Paris-Saclay),  after D. Spasic's version".
   or alternately the article reference https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132318301896
