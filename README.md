# AREP
In this folder you will find two python routines that contain:

  - "VDI_PET_corrected.py" the corrected version of PET after the VDI norm (based on Djordje Spasic's python translation of the fortran code https://github.com/stgeorges)
  - "PET_fsolve_code.py" a more compact and efficient version of PET

You are free to use them on the condition to cite the authors
   "E. Walther (AREP) and Q. Goestchel (ENS Paris-Saclay),  after D. Spasic's version".
